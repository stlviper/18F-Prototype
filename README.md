# openFDAViz

openFDAViz is a cloud based viewer for the openFDA Api Data

### Prerequisites

* Node
* Grunt-cli

openFDAViz is a node.js application that has several Prerequisites. These include, node.js, grunt and npm, you will also need git installed to checkout the application from github. On a new installation of linux the following commands will setup your environment.

```
$ sudo su - 
$ curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup | bash -
$ yum install -y gcc-c++ make nodejs git
$ exit
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

or if you are running ubunu,

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install nodejs npm git
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli 
```

If you get an error about not being able to find node you may need to symlink /usr/bin/nodejs to /usr/bin/node

### Installation for local Testing / Development

This project consist of two parts. One is the Server Side API that makes calls to openFDA API and pre-processes the results while also caching certain values. The second is the User Interface. The server side API code is in the /server/ folder and the UI is in the /client/ folder. Both are managed by npm package manager. The final production code is also designed to run on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk for the server API and S3/Cloudfront CDN for the User Interface. Neither are required to run locally but you will need to create an empty aws.json credentials file for the build to succeed. Once those commands are entered you can start the API node server and a lightweight client server locally and visit the interface. The commands are listed below.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/stlviper/18F-Prototype.git
$ cd 18F-Prototype
$ echo {} > aws.json
$ npm install
$ npm run-script startDev
```

Client will be available at - http://localhost:8000
Server API will be available at - http://localhost:3002

- To deploy and run the production build (minified sources and concatenated css and templates and uploaded to AWS)
$ grunt deploy:prod


### Running Mocha unit tests

Mocha tests are automatically run on a grunt build, which is run on the grunt deploy job as above.

### Running Selenium automated browser tests

- First set up the protractor and webdriver components (wrappers for selenium + angular enhancements)

```
$ cd client
$ npm install -g protractor, to start, first run webdriver-manager start --standalone
$ ./node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update --standalone --chrome
```

- Then start the mock application server and run selenium

```
$ node test/mockserver/mockserver_prod.js &
$ grunt selenium
```
NOTE: to clean up server instance run the following:

```
$ ps aux | grep mockserver
```

kill the process listed below
<user>     27523   0.0  0.2  3054504  32996 s000  S     4:52PM   0:00.27 node test/mockserver/mockserver.js

Or run node mockserver.js in a separate terminal window without the &

###


### Local Development using openFDA Fake Server

```
$ cd fake-api
$ npm install
$ cd ..
$ PORT=3001 node fake-api/bin/www
```
Above will run a fake openFDA server for testing. You can view it at 
    http://localhost:3001/healthcheck/
    
### Deploying in Docker

You will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) already installed and setup. Configuring Docker is outside the scope of this README.

Once you have a working docker environment you can run a docker image using the following command,

```
$ docker run -t -i -p 3002:3002 -p 8000:8000 stlviper/18f-prototype
```

If you are on a OSX you will need to tunnel ports 3002 and 8000 so the client can access the server using localhost, this can be done by issuing the following commands,
```
$ VBoxManage controlvm boot2docker-vm natpf1 "swagger,tcp,127.0.0.1,3002,,3002"
$ VBoxManage controlvm boot2docker-vm natpf1 "client,tcp,127.0.0.1,8000,,8000"
```

To Remove the tunnels when you are done you can issue these commands,
```
$ VBoxManage modifyvm boot2docker-vm --natpf1 delete swagger
$ VBoxManage modifyvm boot2docker-vm --natpf1 delete client
```

Once the Docker image is running you can access it at:

http://localhost:8000/

### Deploying openFDAVizAPI Server on AWS Resources

There is configuration available to deploy all resources to Amazon Web Services, when ready to deploy openFDAViz to your Amazon instance follow the steps below.
*** WARNING ***
Executing the commands below will cost you money as it will start 1 EC2 instance with autoscaling turned on and push objects to S3.

Open aws.json and modify the contents to look like this,

```
{
  "AWSAccessKeyId": "YOUR KeyID",
  "AWSSecretKey": "YOUR SECRET"
}
```

Then you need to have AWS EB Cli Installed (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html) you will be prompted to enter your KeyID and Secret when running the command below.

```
$ cd server
$ eb init
$ eb create
$ eb open
```

You will now have a running version of the openFDAViz app. The eb open command will open the API in your browser.

## *** Summary of Team OGSystems Agile Development Methodology ***

OGSystemsâ€™ agile engineering method centers on user-centric design, using working prototypes and rapid deployment of capabilities to refine solutions. Our unique blend of agile, scaled agile and visual facilitation allows us to quickly respond to challenges scaling from Team to Enterprise.
Team OGSystems created the FDA Prototype following our normal agile software development approach. Our staff of experienced and certified agile practitioners followed business as usual in responding and building the prototype by adding the RFQ response as a high priority project to our normal backlog.
The Product Owner (PO), Chad Dalton set initial priorities and groomed our backlog along the way and was responsible for managing and prioritizing our agile JIRA workflow and lists.
We established a multidisciplinary and collaborative team made up of seven of the identified labor categories out of design Pool One and development Pool Two.
The team elected to use Kanban and established a cadence for a sprint demo, a release demo, and two daily standups to accommodate the accelerated pace and collaboration necessary to meet the delivery deadline.
Immediately following the kick-off meeting we conducted a MindMapping exercise to establish a vision and strategy for the project. The PO and team used the MindMap to create the initial backlog and priorities, and provided a baseline to brainstorm data options and prototype design, Figure 1.

(Figure 1 MindMap)

Our team then self-identified in roles that matched their experience and expertise. We started design development, building wireframes, designing architecture, and scheduling user engagement sessions.
With the initial design phase started, we engaged end customers in a collaborative session to solicit feedback on initial design concepts, Figure 2. This session yielded additional design and development concepts and stories, Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2.

(Figure 2: Customer Engagement)

Our first design priority was to swarm on the architectural runway and build out the initial architecture. Nolan Hager led the devops decisions to get us up and running in AWS using Elastic Beanstalk with a scalable web application that interfaces with the FDA api, Figure 5.
This architecture supports scaling and load balancing based on its server capacity and configuration.

We used several applications to facilitate the collaboration of remotely based teams (Saint Louis; Chantilly, VA), including HipChat for day-to-day interactions, Figure 6, integrated with Jira and Confluence to receive notifications in our 18F chat room and Appear video chat capability.
Little email was generated during this period and collaboration via chat and video was continual. Our Agile workflow was tracked in JIRA, reviewing each task by two or more parties, leveraging Crucible for version controlled, user-story based reviews and GitHub for version control.
Mocha and Selenium used for automatic unit tests and UI testing automatically at were integral to our Test Driven Development Approach, ensuring code quality and reducing cross browser inconstancies. We used a Kanban board to iterate through our stories and track the state of the prototype.
Setting work in progress (WIP) limits in each swim lanes on the Kanban board kept our team lean and allowed us to complete more work with less delay, Figure 7.

(Figure 7: Kanban Snapshot)

The Kanban Snapshot shows a WIP limit alert in Review (Lane 3 of Figure 7). Following our lean process, we focused on clearing out the review lane before proceeding to new work.

All work was tagged in JIRA, using components to help manage our iterations over the design and development process to flush out the prototype, Figure 8.

(Figure 8: Components Snapshot)

We conducted a user demo mid-day Wednesday to test the application and gather one more round of feedback prior to the initial prototype delivery. The accelerated project timeline posed some challenges that we addressed using an Agile software development approach and staying lean across the team, Figure 9.
