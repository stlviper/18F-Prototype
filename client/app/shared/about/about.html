            <h1>Meet the Team</h1>

            <p>For openFDA Viz, Team OGSystem assembled seasoned software engineers, graphic designers and agile
                engineers to assemble a working prototype using user centric design methods, modern technologies and
                flexible infrastructure. The openFDA Viz team used standardized methodologies to iterate over several
                designs and implementations with constant user feedback. The agile approach used to build openFDA Viz is
                the same approach OGSystems uses to attack all of our customers problems. We have had success applying
                agile in small teams and in enterprise scale teams using the <a href="http://scaledagileframework.com/">Scaled
                    Agile Framework (SAFe)</a>. Using this methodology we are able to apply the same agile approach at
                any scale problem.</p>
