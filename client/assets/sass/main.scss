/* NOTE:
 * Started doing it this way because Paul and I (Nolan) found an issue with  multiple scss files to one in grunt sass would
 * sometimes only grab the first one in the directory OR if one errored out it would queitly keeping the rest in
 * the directory from gettting added. Also thought about concat all the scss to one file first then compile them but went
 * with this way because is was super simple to make sure everything was included and IF for some reason ordering needed
 * to be done then it is simple to do
